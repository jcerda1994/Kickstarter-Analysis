# Kickstarter-Analysis

Kickstarting with Excel
Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Louise for a recommendation for her playwright crowdfunding campaign.


Analysis and Challenges


I performed this analysis using the pivot table to cerate charts to easily analyze the outcomes based on launch date separated by successful, failed and canceled and the percentage of outcomes separated by range goals.

At plain sight, the theater campaign is the best category that fits in the recommendation because of the number of crowdfunding as well as the number of success outcomes

Additionally, the best months to get crowdfuning in the theather category is between may and june based on the data.


Personally i did not find any challenge in this particular exercise, however the analysis that can be made is so diverse.


Results:
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first analysis that can be drawn for this is informing Louise the different outcomes based on a monthly basis in order to make a better decision for getting the crowdfunding campaign. We can see the best months to get a crowdfunding is by spring-summer season in the theather category

The other conclusion is to to be drawn is to inform that the failed and canceled funds is way below the successful outcomes.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 

To give a visual example of the percentage of outcomes based on a range of goals in order to inform Louise in which range of goals is concentrated the successful and failed outcomes for better decision making. We can see the successful and failed outcomes were concentrated in the ranges between $1000-$15,000. 



What are some limitations of this dataset?
In my personal knowledge i don't see any limitation with data because we have the skills and tools to get the best of the information.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

There are many graphs that may be created, for example the bar chart and a histogram.
