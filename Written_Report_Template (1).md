# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to define the concepts of pivot tables, charts and formulas to filter information in order to analyze real world data and to make better decisions.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis using the pivot table to visually see the outcomes based on launch date separated by successful, failed and canceled.

I made a table with range percentages in order to know the same outcomes based in goals chart, in both analysis I made a chart to better visualization.

Personally i did not find any challenge in this particular exercise, the countifs function may be a little bit tricky sometismes.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
the first conclusion is to determine the the different possible coutcomes of the theater category displayed by date.

Another analysis that can be drawn for this is for informing Louise the different outcomes based on a monthly basis in order to make a better decision for getting the crowdfunding


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
To give a visual example of the percentage of outcomes based on a range of goals in order to inform Louise in which range of goals is concentrated the successful and failed outcomes for better decision making

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
in my personal knowledge i don't see any limitation with data because we have the skills and tools to get the best of the information.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

There are many graphs that may be created, for example the bar chart and a histogram
